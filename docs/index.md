# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics curriculum. This course explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical robotics, focusing on creating intelligent systems that can interact with the physical world through humanoid robots.

## Course Modules

This course is organized into multiple modules covering different aspects of physical AI and humanoid robotics:

- **[Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](/docs/modules/physical-ai-robotics/module-1-ros2-nervous-system/module-overview)** - Fundamentals of ROS 2, AI agent integration, and robot modeling with URDF

## About This Course

This curriculum provides both theoretical foundations and practical implementation guidance for developing AI-driven humanoid robots. Each module includes:

- Core concepts and principles
- Practical implementation examples
- Exercises and challenges
- Integration with real-world robotics platforms

## Getting Started

Begin with Module 1 to establish the foundational understanding of ROS 2 as the "nervous system" of intelligent humanoid robots.
