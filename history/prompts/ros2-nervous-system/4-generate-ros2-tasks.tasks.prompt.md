## Prompt

```
/sp.tasks
```

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task list for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2). Created 44 specific tasks organized across 6 phases: Setup, Foundational, and 3 user stories (P1-P3) plus Polish phase. Tasks follow the required format with IDs, story labels, and file paths. Organized to enable independent implementation and testing of each user story.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete task breakdown with 44 specific, actionable tasks
- 🧪 Tests: Not applicable (no explicit tests requested in feature spec)
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with proper structure and organization
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation following task list
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks organized by user story priority enabling MVP approach

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Not applicable
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Not applicable
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation with Phase 1 tasks
